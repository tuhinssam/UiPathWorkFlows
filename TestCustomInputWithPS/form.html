Here is the example for using a Custom Input Activity.
A webpage needs to be created in order to use the activities.


In this case we have a really simple HTML form 
The page has no limitations in terms of the libraries you can use for the HTML 
-->
<h2>Simple Form</h2>

<form action="/action_page.php">
  First name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="firstname" id="FirstName">
  <br>
  Last name:<br>
  <input type="text" name="lastname" id="LastName">
  <br>
  Age:<br>
  <input type="text" name="age" id="Age">
  <br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" id="SubmitButton">
</form> 



<script>
   document.getElementById("SubmitButton").onclick = function() {

		// After the values have been submited we gather all the relevant data
   		var FirstName = document.getElementById("FirstName").value;
   		var LastName = document.getElementById("LastName").value;
   		var Age = document.getElementById("Age").value;

   		// Contrusct a json string shich contain the values
   		var OutputString = "{\"First_Name\":\"" + FirstName + "\","  +  "\"Last_Name\":\"" + LastName + "\"," + "\"Age\":\"" + Age + "\"}";

   		// Here is the important bit. For a to be valid in terms of the activity the following line needs to be included and called at some point in the execution of the form.
   		//Once the command has been called a string can be passed back to UiPath and the form will close
   		window.external.setResult(OutputString);
   		};
</script>
